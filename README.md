###### Common Python Data Structures (Guide)

### Prerequisites
- 1st you should know python syntax.
- You should complete basic knowledge of Python.
- If you know about any programing language like C, C++, Java it will be plus point.
```python
x = 3+4j < 5+7j
print(x)
```

```python
for x in range(6):
  if x == 3: break
  print(x)
else:
  print("Finally finished!")
```
> TypeError: `<` not supported between instances of `complex` and `complex`

```python
x = 200
print(isinstance(x, int))
```
